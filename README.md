Simple Pets emotion detector using Machine learning                                                                                                                                 
.Create a feature to predict the emotions of animals whether its happy,sad or hungry.It should be able to predict the emotions of group of animals and mark emotions of each animal.we should trigger an notification like pop up saying like in the format of "Animal Name + Emotion" if group of animals are there it should mention all animals name and emotions in the pop up message
